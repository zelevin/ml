# Introduction to Deep Learning

Since teaching is the final stage of learning, I wanted to put together a clear, straightforward, from-scratch introduction to machine learning.  I was writing this in my spare time and got through first two parts: linear regression and logistic regression. This needs at least two more parts: neural networks and generative neural networks (possibly also some material on convolutional networks).
